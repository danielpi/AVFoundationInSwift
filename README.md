# AV Foundation in Swift

That is too bold a title for this project, but I'm stuck with it now.

Basically I am wanting to use video and camera inputs in some of my projects and I am using the examples in this repository to help me learn. When I have used these sorts of frameworks in other programming environments (Python, Matlab, OpenCV etc) I find that it is easy to get an image or a video up at first. However it is often difficult to then incorporate that functionality into a high quality UI. AV Foundation has proven to be different in my experience. It appears to require a lot of none obvious setup to get anything to work, but it is built alongside Appkit so it should be simple to incorporate it into a native Mac UI.

I plan to create several projects with each being as focused as possible on a single task or use case that is of interest. In this way I hope to distill what is actually required for each task so that it is easier to understand.

## Project 1 - Display a feed from a camera
